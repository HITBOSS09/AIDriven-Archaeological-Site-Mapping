# Week 2: Data Augmentation Strategy for YOLOv8 Training
# This configuration will be used in Week 3 for model training

# Augmentation parameters for YOLOv8
# These settings enhance model robustness and generalization

# Geometric Augmentations
hsv_h: 0.015          # Image HSV-Hue augmentation (fraction)
hsv_s: 0.7            # Image HSV-Saturation augmentation (fraction)
hsv_v: 0.4            # Image HSV-Value augmentation (fraction)

degrees: 10.0         # Image rotation (+/- deg)
translate: 0.1        # Image translation (+/- fraction)
scale: 0.5            # Image scale (+/- gain)
shear: 0.0            # Image shear (+/- deg)
perspective: 0.0      # Image perspective (+/- fraction), range 0-0.001

# Flip Augmentations
flipud: 0.0           # Image flip up-down (probability)
fliplr: 0.5           # Image flip left-right (probability)

# Mosaic and MixUp
mosaic: 1.0           # Image mosaic (probability) - combines 4 images
mixup: 0.1            # Image mixup (probability) - blends 2 images

# Copy-Paste Augmentation
copy_paste: 0.1       # Segment copy-paste (probability)

# Additional Augmentations
auto_augment: randaugment  # Auto augmentation policy (randaugment, autoaugment, augmix)
erasing: 0.4          # Random erasing probability during classification training

# Crop Settings
crop_fraction: 1.0    # Image crop fraction for classification

# Training Hyperparameters (for reference in Week 3)

# Additional Options
patience: 50         # Epochs to wait for no observable improvement for early stopping
